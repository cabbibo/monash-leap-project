<div>I would like the authentication dialog to be below this;</div>

<div id='authentication'>
this div MUST be declared, with id 'authentication' (it will contain the authentication dialog)
all contents of this div will be cleared when authenticate() is called and will not ever be restored (so leave blank)
</div>

<div>but above this.</div>
<div>The authentication dialog won't be visible until I run authenticate()<br>and remain visible until authentication is complete<div>

<!--Must import these files before authenticate() is called-->
<script type="text/javascript" src="libraries/sha1.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="libraries/codebird.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src='authentication.js'></script>

<script type="text/javascript">

// start the authentication process whenever you want, passing a defined function name
authenticate(signal);

// authenticate() does not halt javascript execution in this file; the following will print during authentication
console.log('execution continues!');

// function that will be called after the authentication process is completed (you passed to authenticate())
function signal() {

	// a
	console.log('auth complete');
}


</script>
